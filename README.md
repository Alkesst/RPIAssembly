# RPISimonAssembly
We're making some programs on Assembly code for ARM architecture, we'll use the WiringPi library found at http://wiringpi.com, and a custom library called libberry. Libberry is found at this rep.

You will need to compile first the libberry.o:
```bash
as libberry.s -o libberry.o
```
After doing the link you should "compile" your file with this:
```bash
as -g dicerollSimulator.s -o dicerollSimulator.o
```
Then, when you got you'r library compiled, you'll need to link with the "main" file:
```bash
gcc â€“o dicerollSimulator dicerollSimulator.o libberry.o -lwiringPi
```
